# Telegram Userbot Warmup Tool

A tool that simulates communication between Telegram bots to make them appear more human, improving their rating and gaining higher rate limits.

It automates fake interactions, such as sending messages between bots and mimicking natural behavior (typing, replies, emojis, randomized delays, sleep during the night etc.), helping userbots avoid being flagged as automated. Useful to prep for large-scale ops.

# TODO

* LLM pre-generated convos
* fix messing up message order
* replies
* support >2 bots
* catch exceptions properly
* delay on ratelimits
* proper colored debug prints
